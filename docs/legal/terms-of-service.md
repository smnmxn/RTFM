# Terms of Service

**Last updated:** January 30, 2025

---

## Welcome

These terms govern your use of supportpages.io. By using the service, you agree to these terms.

We've written this in plain language because we want you to actually read it. The legally binding parts are still here, just without the unnecessary complexity.

---

## What supportpages.io Does

supportpages.io is a developer tool that:
- Connects to your GitHub repositories
- Analyzes code changes when you merge PRs
- Generates user-facing documentation automatically
- Hosts your documentation on customizable pages

You remain in control of what gets published. We generate drafts; you approve them.

---

## Your Account

### Creating an Account

You create an account by signing in with GitHub. You're responsible for:
- Keeping your GitHub account secure
- All activity under your account
- Notifying us if you suspect unauthorized access

### Account Requirements

You must:
- Be at least 16 years old
- Provide accurate information
- Have authority to connect repositories you add (either you own them or have admin access)

### One Account Per Person

Each person should have one account. Don't share accounts or create multiple accounts to circumvent limits.

---

## What You Grant Us Access To

When you connect a repository, you authorize us to:

### Read Access
- Repository metadata (name, branches, settings)

3. Or disconnect repositories in our Settings page

1. Email us describing the issue
2. We'll try to resolve it within 30 days
3. If unresolved, you may pursue legal remedies

### Jurisdiction
Legal proceedings will be in the courts of Finland, unless consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction require otherwise.

---

## Changes to These Terms

We may update these terms. When we do:
- We'll update the "Last updated" date

- Continued use after changes means acceptance

If you don't agree with changes, stop using the service and delete your account.

---

## General

These terms, plus our Privacy Policy and any other policies we reference, make up the whole agreement.

### Severability
If any part of these terms is unenforceable, the rest still applies.

### No Waiver
If we don't enforce something once, it doesn't mean we waive our right to enforce it later.

### Assignment
You can't transfer your account. We can transfer our obligations if we're acquired (we'll notify you).
