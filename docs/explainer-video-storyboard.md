## Scene 1: The Feeling
**Duration: 5 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Dark screen. Cursor blinks. Code editor fades in—someone hitting "merge" on a PR. Confetti animation. Success. | *"Every developer knows this feeling."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Cinematic close-up of a developer's hands on a mechanical keyboard, dark room illuminated only by monitor glow. Camera pushes in slowly toward the screen showing a code editor. The developer clicks a green "Merge" button, confetti particles explode across the screen in celebration. Shallow depth of field, moody blue and purple lighting, tech noir aesthetic. 4K, 24fps filmic motion blur.
```

**Transition:** Quick cut

---

## Scene 2: The Celebration... Then Reality
**Duration: 7 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Slack notifications popping in: heart emojis, "shipped!", celebration. Then—*ding ding ding*—support tickets start flooding in. Red notification badges multiply. | *"You ship a feature. Users love it. And then... the support tickets start."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Over-the-shoulder shot of a developer's monitor. Slack notifications pop up with celebratory emojis and "Shipped!" messages, floating upward like bubbles. Mood is warm and triumphant. Then the color temperature shifts cooler—red notification badges begin appearing, multiplying rapidly across the screen. Camera slowly dollies back as badges overwhelm the frame. Modern office environment, soft ambient lighting transitioning to harsh blue. Anxious energy builds.
```

**Transition:** Notifications fill screen

---

## Scene 3: The Questions
**Duration: 5 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Support tickets zoom into focus, one at a time. Clean typography on dark background: "How do I use this?" then "Where's the documentation?" | *"How do I use this?" "Where's the documentation?"* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Minimal dark void background. White support ticket cards fly toward camera from the distance, each stopping center-frame momentarily. First card reads "How do I use this?" in clean sans-serif typography, holds for a beat, then flies past camera. Second card "Where's the documentation?" follows same pattern. Cards have subtle drop shadows, slight rotation on approach. Kinetic typography style, Apple-keynote aesthetic, smooth motion with gentle easing.
```

**Transition:** Tickets scatter

---

## Scene 4: The Outdated Docs
**Duration: 6 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| A help center page. Zoom into "Last updated: 6 months ago" with dust particles floating. Page content visibly mismatched with modern UI screenshots shown side-by-side. | *"You look at your help docs. They're six months out of date."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Camera slowly zooms into a browser window showing an old help documentation page. The page looks dated, faded colors. Macro lens focus pulls to the text "Last updated: 6 months ago" as golden dust particles drift across the frame like an abandoned library. Split-screen wipe reveals modern app UI on the right, clearly mismatched with the old docs on the left. Melancholic lighting, desaturated tones, sense of neglect and decay. Cinematic shallow depth of field.
```

**Transition:** Slow dissolve

---

## Scene 5: The Hard Truth
**Duration: 8 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Split screen: Left shows developer at desk, looking at empty doc template. Right shows frustrated user staring at laptop. Both sigh simultaneously. | *"Here's the thing. We all know documentation matters. But nobody wants to write it. So we don't. And our users suffer."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Symmetrical split-screen composition. Left side: developer at modern desk setup, staring at blank documentation template on screen, hand on chin, defeated posture. Right side: end user at home office, squinting at laptop with confused expression, scrolling helplessly. Both filmed in matching medium shots with identical camera angles. Simultaneously, both subjects exhale and slump slightly. Left side has cool blue tech lighting, right side has warm home lighting. Both share same sense of frustration. Empathetic, documentary-style naturalism.
```

**Transition:** Both screens fade to black

---

## Scene 6: The Question
**Duration: 5 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Black screen. Text types out letter by letter: "What if your documentation..." pause "...wrote itself?" Text glows softly. | *"What if your documentation... wrote itself?"* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Pure black void. White text types on screen character by character like a terminal: "What if your documentation..." Text pauses, cursor blinks three times. Then continues: "...wrote itself?" On completion, the text pulses with soft white glow, subtle lens bloom effect. Minimal, stark, powerful. Text centered in frame with generous negative space. The glow intensifies slightly on "wrote itself" creating moment of magic and possibility. Clean typography, cinematic aspect ratio.
```

**Transition:** Text explodes into particles

---

## Scene 7: The Reveal
**Duration: 4 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| SupportPages logo animates in. Clean, bold. Slight lens flare. Hero gradient background. | *[pause]* *"This is SupportPages."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
The typed text from previous scene explodes into thousands of luminous particles that swirl and coalesce, reforming into the SupportPages logo center frame. Logo is clean, modern, bold. Background transitions to rich gradient of deep purple to electric blue. Subtle lens flare crosses the logo as it locks into place. Camera holds steady, hero shot energy. Premium brand reveal moment, Apple-product-launch quality. Particles settle and fade, leaving crisp logo against gradient.
```

**Transition:** Logo shrinks to corner, UI expands

---

## Scene 8: The Connection
**Duration: 10 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Screen recording style: SupportPages dashboard. Click "Connect Repository." GitHub OAuth popup. Select repo. Connected checkmark. Progress bar shows "Analyzing codebase..." with file names streaming past. | *"You connect your GitHub repo. Just like that. And our AI reads your entire codebase. It understands your product. Your features. Your users."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Floating browser window against dark gradient background, showing SupportPages dashboard UI. Camera orbits slowly around the window as cursor clicks "Connect Repository" button. GitHub authorization popup slides in, repo is selected, green checkmark animation confirms connection. Progress bar appears: "Analyzing codebase..." with code filenames streaming past rapidly like Matrix-style data visualization. The stream of filenames creates flowing light trails. Holographic UI aesthetic, depth and dimension, clean dark mode interface with accent color highlights. Smooth 60fps motion.
```

**Transition:** Analysis complete pulse

---

## Scene 9: The Magic Moment
**Duration: 12 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| GitHub PR view: "Add dark mode toggle" merged. Webhook fires (visualized as glowing data stream). SupportPages inbox—new recommendation appears: "How to Enable Dark Mode." Article preview slides in showing title, steps, auto-generated screenshot. | *"Now watch what happens. You merge a pull request. Instantly, SupportPages analyzes the change. Not what code changed. What changed for your users. And it writes a help article. A real one. With steps. With screenshots. Ready to publish."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Dynamic multi-panel sequence. Panel 1: GitHub PR interface, "Add dark mode toggle" merges with satisfying animation. Panel 2: Glowing data stream launches from GitHub, traveling through abstract digital space like a comet trail of light particles. Panel 3: Stream arrives at SupportPages inbox, new card materializes with shimmer effect: "How to Enable Dark Mode". Panel 4: Article preview expands elegantly—title, numbered steps appearing one by one, screenshot generating with AI sparkle effect. Camera moves fluidly between panels as if one continuous shot through connected digital spaces. Magical, instantaneous, seamless. Electric blue and purple color palette, premium motion graphics aesthetic.
```

**Transition:** Article zooms to fill screen

---

## Scene 10: One-Click Publishing
**Duration: 8 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Article review screen. Mouse hovers over "Approve" button—click. Green success. Click "Publish." Article flies into the help center grid, slots into place perfectly. Satisfying *click* sound. | *[pause]* *"You review it. One click to approve. One click to publish. Done."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Clean UI shot of article review screen floating in space. Cursor hovers over green "Approve" button—micro-interaction: button glows on hover. Click. Ripple effect, green checkmark appears with satisfying bounce animation. Then cursor moves to "Publish" button, clicks. The article card lifts off the screen, camera follows as it flies through abstract space toward a grid of published articles (the help center). Article slots perfectly into an empty space in the grid with magnetic snap effect, subtle particle burst on landing. Camera pulls back to reveal complete, organized help center. Satisfying, tactile, precise. ASMR-level visual satisfaction.
```

**Transition:** Pull back to reveal full help center

---

## Scene 11: The User Experience
**Duration: 12 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Beautiful public help center. User searches "dark mode"—instant results. Clicks article, scrolls through clean steps. Then: AI chat bubble opens. User types question, streaming response appears with source citations. User smiles (illustrated or filmed). | *"Your documentation is now always up to date. Every feature. Every update. Automatically. And your users? They get a beautiful help center. With search. With AI chat that actually answers their questions."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Warm, inviting scene. Over-shoulder shot of a happy user at laptop viewing beautiful help center website. User types "dark mode" in search bar, results appear instantly with smooth animation. Click on article, camera pushes into screen showing clean step-by-step guide. Transition: AI chat widget bounces open in corner, user types question, response streams in word-by-word with typing indicator. Small source citation links appear below answer. Cut to: user's face, genuine smile of relief and satisfaction, bathed in warm screen glow. Bright, optimistic color grading. The feeling of problems solved, questions answered. Human and technology in harmony.
```

**Transition:** Soft fade

---

## Scene 12: The Close
**Duration: 8 seconds**

| Visual | Audio |
|--------|-------|
| Developer at desk, shipping code confidently. Monitor shows PR merged. Second monitor shows help center updating in real-time. Text overlay fades in: **"You ship code. We ship the docs."** SupportPages logo. URL. | *[pause]* *"No more writing docs at midnight. No more 'we'll update that later.' No more frustrated users. You ship code. We ship the docs. That's SupportPages."* |

**Veo 3.1 Prompt:**
```
Wide shot of confident developer at premium desk setup, dual monitors. Developer hits merge on left screen with casual ease, leans back satisfied. Right monitor shows help center—new article appears automatically, subtle glow effect. Camera slowly dollies in as text fades up center frame: "You ship code. We ship the docs." Bold, clean typography. Hold for beat, then SupportPages logo fades in below with website URL. Background softens to gradient, text and logo become hero focus. Aspirational, empowering energy. Golden hour lighting mixed with screen glow. The feeling of a problem permanently solved. Fade to black with logo centered, lingering.
```

**Transition:** Fade to black with logo centered

## Veo 3.1 Generation Notes

### Prompt Best Practices Used
- **Camera direction:** Every prompt includes specific camera movements (dolly, push in, orbit, etc.)
- **Lighting:** Mood-appropriate lighting specified (tech noir, warm, golden hour)
- **Motion quality:** Frame rate and motion blur noted where important
- **Style references:** Apple keynote, premium brand aesthetic referenced for consistency
- **Emotion:** Each scene describes the intended emotional impact
- **Transitions:** Visual continuity maintained (particles, data streams connect scenes)

### Recommended Generation Settings
- **Aspect ratio:** 16:9 cinematic
- **Duration:** Generate 6-8 seconds per clip, trim to fit
- **Style consistency:** Use same seed/style reference across scenes for cohesion
- **Resolution:** 4K preferred, minimum 1080p

### Post-Production Assembly
1. Generate each scene clip from Veo
2. Color grade for consistency across all clips
3. Add UI screen recordings as overlays where specified (Scenes 8-11)
4. Layer in typography and logo assets
5. Sync to voiceover timing
6. Add music bed and SFX
7. Final timing adjustments for pause beats
